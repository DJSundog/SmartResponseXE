Features:
---------
1) Initialize LCD controller into 4-level grayscale mode
2) Fill display with any byte pattern
3) Draw 3 sizes of text (6x8, 9x8, 15x8) with any background or foreground color

Getting Started:
---------------
The first thing to do is initialize and clear the LCD. The pin numbers for the SRXE are:
  // CS, D/C, RESET
  SRXEInit(7, 24, 18); // initialize display
Next, you can draw some text or rectangles. The color can be 0-3 (0=off, 3=fully on)
  SRXEWriteString(0,120,"Hello World!", FONT_LARGE, 3, 0); // draw large black text at x=0,y=120, fg=3, bg=0
